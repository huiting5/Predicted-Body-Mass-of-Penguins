**Data Sources & Data Description** 
Dr. Kristen Gorman’s “palmer penguins” data set is a built-in
data set in the R library. There are two data sets with this package. Penguins_raw which contains 17
variables, and a simplified version of penguins_raw, just called penguins has 8 variables. The project
used the pakage of penguins. This data set contains information on three species of penguins - Adelie,
Chinstrap, and Gentoo. This data was gathered from the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. The
data set includes measurements of body mass, flipper length, bill length, and other characteristics for
each penguin. The data set originally published in Ecological Sexual Dimorphism and Environmental
Variability within a Community of Antarctic Penguins by Gorman KB, Williams TD and Fraser WR
in 2014. There are 344 penguins recorded and 8 variables. There are some missing values in the data
set. To remove the missing data because it didn’t give enough information to predict the body mass
of the penguin. We remove 11 penguins’ records.
